## Hi, I am Saurav ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about building innovative and scalable web applications. Although I have a degree in Biotechnology, my interests lie in web development, where I primarily work with **React**, **NodeJS**, and **TypeScript**.

I love building challenging projects and enjoy deep-diving into topics until I understand them completely. Iâ€™m currently developing **"Chess"**, an online multiplayer chess platform that lets users play against the Stockfish engine offline. I also created **"Code Execution Engine,"** a Docker-based system that supports multi-language code execution.
